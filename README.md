# LGMVIP-Web-Task-4

Just completed Intermediate Level -Task 4 at LGMVIP Internship! a fully functional calculator built with React. This dynamic web application offers users an interactive experience for performing basic arithmetic operations, showcasing my growing proficiency in React development

Here are Explained Features :
1.Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/) are supported.
2.Modulus Functionality: The calculator includes a '%' button for calculating modulus.
3.Clear and Delete Functions: The 'C' button clears both the input and result, providing a quick reset. The 'X' button functions as a delete button, removing the last entered character from the input.

8.User-Friendly Interface: Buttons are organized in rows, and each button has an onClick event associated with it, allowing for an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
9.Preventing Unintended User Inputs: The calculator ensures that users cannot input multiple operators consecutively, avoiding common calculation errors.
